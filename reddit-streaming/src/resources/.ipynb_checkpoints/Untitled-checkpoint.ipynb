      "The beauty of CB is the flexibility of the weapon. Have a hammer bro? Go for tail. Have a GS? Go for head to KO. Have both? Go for feet and get trips. You can go for big hits and KOs or you can stay in in sns mode forever with a status CB. Fill whatever role the team needs and you'll be guaranteed better clear times and more broken parts. I try not to overlap because CB is very prone to tripping, but with good positioning, you can easily share a head with hammer if you really need the KO. \n",

It's fine to try to style on the monster solo, but if I miss the GP online, I'll get hit, be in axe mode when I get out, and get hit by a follow up attack because Im too slow. Definitely carted to this many times. Most of the time after you get a GP, you should be looking to evade the next attack since monsters get so aggressive in g rank. Thus, you probably shouldn't have been there in the first place. I try to combo such that it takes me through and past the monster. For example, there's an opening head on, X+A to dash in -&gt; charge A-&gt; X+A-&gt;X+A -&gt; R to charge shield-&gt; evade forward. That should take you all the way through the monster and a good distance behind him. The side evades are great for this too. Where you finish your combo is just as important as when you start and the CB has great tools for this to make up for it's lower walk and sheath speed.

This stage is often complicated by an infection of the lung known as [pneumocystis pneumonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumocystis_pneumonia), [severe weight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cachexia), a type of cancer known as [Kaposi's sarcoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaposi%27s_sarcoma), or other [AIDS-defining conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS-defining_clinical_condition).\n",

The enemy couldn't break threw the defense so they decided to starve us of resource so the base would lose power and to go neutral giving the attackers a much needed advantage.After you notice the NTU drain you send 2 squads back to the warpgate with air and armor defense for a ant run.2 mins left before the NTU runs out and the loadstars are in the air with the ants in back.The armor and air left the warp gate mins before ,and are clearing out the enemy armor and air in and around the NTU silo. As the loadstars fly over the base  you make the call for friendly  emp's to go off to clear the way for the ants,and with seconds left the NTU silo is refiling and the base is safe, or so you thought.

Some psychologists have criticized the program on the grounds that it may lead to [overjustification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect) and reduce children's intrinsic interest in reading.  However, a study of the program found that participation in the program neither increased nor decreased reading motivation.  The program's 25th anniversary was in 2009. The Book It! program in Australia ceased in 2002 when Pizza Hut in Australia was removing its dine-in stores as Australians opted for take away pizza instead of dine-in.

      "&gt;__Abraham__ (/ˈeɪbrəˌhæm, -həm/ ([Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language): אַבְרָהָם‎,  listen (help·info))), originally __Abram__, is the first of the three [biblical patriarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchs_(Bible\\)). His story, told in chapters 11 through 25 of the [Book of Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis), plays a prominent role in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;The narrative revolves around the themes of posterity and land rights. Abraham was called by God to leave the house of his father [Terah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terah) and settle in a land which was already settled by the descendants of [Canaan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan_(biblical_figure\\)); however, God promised it to Abraham and his progeny. Various candidates were put forward who might inherit the land after him, but all were dismissed except for [Isaac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac), Abraham's son by his half-sister [Sarah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah). Abraham purchased the [Cave of the Patriarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs) at [Hebron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron) to be Sarah's grave when she died, thus establishing his right to that land. In the second generation, Abraham's heir Isaac was married to a woman from his own relatives, thus ruling the Canaanites out of any right to his inheritance. Abraham later married [Keturah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keturah) and had six more sons, but on his death, when he was buried beside Sarah, it was Isaac who received \"all Abraham's goods\", while the other sons received only \"gifts\". \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;The Bible's internal chronology places Abraham around 2000 BCE.  Despite this, \"there is nothing specific in the Genesis stories that can be definitively related to known history in or around Canaan in the early second millennium B.C.E.\"  As a result, \"it is now widely agreed that the so-called 'patriarchal/ancestral period' is a later literary construct, not a period in the actual history of the ancient world\" (Professor Paula McNutt).  The majority of scholars believe that the [Pentateuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentateuch) was composed in the Persian period (roughly 520–320 BCE),  as a result of tensions between the Jewish landowners who had stayed in Judah during the [Babylonian captivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity) and claimed Abraham as the \"father\" through whom they traced their right to the land, and the returning \"Priestly\" exiles who based their claim to dominance on [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses) and [the Exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus) tradition. \n",

      "I love pathology.  The hardest part of becoming a pathologist is getting in to medical school, that's absolutely for sure.  If you're determined, repeat application is actually a good strategy.   DO candidates can usually get a solid pathology residency, by the way.\n",

      "4) Hours and call after training - On average ++, there are easier and harder jobs.  To make in academics you have to work hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Live wherever you want - +, there are not that many pathologists in the world.  I'm in the suburbs of a great city.  The specialties that might allow you to live in some beach or mountain or college small town paradise are pretty much family practice, pediatrics, and maybe general internal medicine or emergency medicine.  Pathologists are mainly concentrated in densely populated areas, typically in cities and suburbs.  If you work hard and stay positive in your residency or fellowship you can usually get a job in the general area.  I would say it's decently easy to be in the New York or Chicago area; in fact I just finished a fellowship in the Chicago area and found a job here.  LA I don't really know.  San Francisco or Portland OR might be tricky - super popular without a lot of pathology programs.  Seattle I'm not sure.  Other areas are fairly obtainable but it's a good idea to train where you want to settle down, if you know that.\n",

Along with this on the heroes that do spam lvl 1 spells, they would most likely have bottle anyway, before ever needing mana. Hp wise, it again doesn't help very much. It will maybe let you get a few extra cs in the first 2 minutes, before the enemy has bottle, but besides that it doesn't provide anything. The real reason it can be useful is EITHER in melee mids that have trouble getting bottle anyway (Ember, so on), or on heroes that want a super fast item timing and it will speed them up by 700+ gold (Naga, so on).

      "There are a bunch of systems out there, all intended for different uses, but I'm going to assume (since you said \"weapon\") that you're looking for something for self defense/range class/airsoft usage, which is, to say, a tactical usage. Luckily, there are a number of kits you could assemble for around your stated budget. The major components are as follows:\n",

      "\n",
      "* Nods- Gen. 3 PVS-14's: These are U.S. Standard issue, and if you hunt on eBay, you can find them at $1500 or lower. Unless you're offered a really sweet deal on Gen. 2's (sub-1k) don't bother. The Gen. 3 tubes will probably have less hours. There's a bunch of different distinctions on the tubes, some will say \"OMNI\" some will say \"Thin Film,\" these terms won't make a big difference for you, just get a cheap used starter pair, and if you want to upgrade, they'll hold their value pretty well. The PVS-14 has a lot of aftermarket support in terms of parts and knowledge, plus, with an adapter, you can co-witness it with a compatible red dot, making it weapon mountable. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* Mounting Solution- Wilcox L4 G11 and USGI J-arm: Beware the sticker shock when shopping for a mount, they are pricey. This combo will cost you about $300, which sounds insane for a few small pieces of metal and plastic... until you consider that this is what keeps your $1500+ device attached to your head. There's also a lot of engineering that goes into these little things: ergonomics, metallurgy, mechanical. The above combo is middle of the road, you could go cheaper with a older generation USGI Rhino, or higher quality with an INVG or L4 G24, but this is the best balance between cost and performance, IMHO. Better to get one at a place like TNVC.com, eBay is full of fakes.\n",
      "\n",

      "* Helmet- Team Wendy LTP: I have one and I love it. Many people prefer a helmet to a \"skullcrusher\" holding their system on their head. There are two basic options, the LTP, and the Ops Core Base Jump. These are \"bump\" helmets, basically custom skateboard helmets, and both companies have more advanced (and expensive) models for sale. Each helmet has a special system that prevents the helmet from slipping forward from the weight of the NVG, as well as rails to attach accessories like action cams and flashlights, and a molded-in socket to connect the mount to. You can buy mounts separately, but why bother? The LTP is my choice because it has a metal insert that forms a much more solid connection with the mount.\n",

      "* Other Stuff: Buying night vision is the start of a long, expensive journey. You're eventually going to want a whole host of other stuff. A weapon mounted, long range IR illuminator will help you identify far away targets. An IR laser will allow you to aim and snap shoot (sights become useless). An IR strobe allows you to broadcast your position to friendly (and unfriendly) NVG users. IR chemlights allow you to mark terrain features, among other uses. A counterweight pouch will ease the strain on your neck, a sacrificial lens is a good investment against breaking an objective, it goes on and on. \n",

      "Aaaaah.  You're an engineer.  OK, let me take another crack at this.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you basically need to understand is that a neuron has a voltage across its membrane at all times, that that voltage is due to a complex (im)balance of different ions.  When the neuron isn't doing anything, some current leaks across the membrane, but there are \"ion pumps\" that move all of the ions back to where they are supposed to be and maintain the cell's membrane voltage, sort of like pumping water uphill.  This potential difference is a source of potential energy, which the neuron can then translate into rapid fluctuations in membrane potential when required.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here is the tricky thing:  Because so many parts of the neuron are so thin *AND* because the membrane is literally covered with various mechanisms that work to keep the membrane potential riht where it is, a change in membrane potential at *one* location in the neuron does not instantly cause a change in membrane potential throughout the rest of the neuron.  An influx of current into the cell can only alter the membrane voltage *locally*, because the influx of current won't make it very far down a dendrite or axon or what-have-you.  This is especially true because whatever event caused the influx of current is usually transient.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, all that the opening of some neurotransmitter-gated channels at a synapse can really do is temporarily and locally make the membrane potential less negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "UNLESS there are enough such events that they add up to enough to raise the membrane voltage from its resting state (-70 mV) to a magical threshold (usually around -55 mV).  If there's enough current coming in to raise the membrane potential (specifically, the membrane potential at the part of the cell body called the [axon hillock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Axon_Hillock.png) by those 15 millivolts, then something magical happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Special voltage-gated sodium channels are triggered when the voltage goes above -55 mV.  They allow huge influxes of current into the cell, which are strong enough to furhter raise the membrane voltage all the way up above zero, and actually make the inside of the cell temporarily *positive* (up to about +40 mV).  Then a bunch of other mechanisms take over and shoot the membrane potential back down belwo -70.  This part lasts under a millisecond.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the amount of current that flows in during that millisecond is *just* enough to flow a ways down the axon, and raise the membrane voltage *in the first little stretch of the axon* up to the threshold of -55 mV.  So then there's a huge influx of sodium ions *there*.  And then that influxof current flows down the axon a little further, and triggers voltage gated sodium channels *there*, and so on.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So there's a slightly more in-depth version.  At every single point along the entire cell's membrane, the membrane voltage of -70 millivolts is being tirelessly maintained.  Chemical signals from other cells can let in enough current to change the membrane voltage a little bit, locally.  But sometimes those signals add up to enough to raise the membrane voltage enough that it results in a (very brief) positive feedback loop, which lets in enough current to actually change the membrane voltage at *neighboring* spots on the membrane, which turns it into a chain reaction that can propagate all the way down the axon to the terminal.  And that's called an action potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then at the terminal a bunch of other really complicated stuff happens.  Basically, current flowing into the terminal and changing the membrane voltage in the terminal causes the terminal to spit out gobs of neurotransmitter.  Which can then go help start the whole process over in another neuron.\n",
      "\n",

      "For example, one implementation could be for when each crate is compiled, \n",
      "the collective public interface exposed for the entire crate is concatenated and hashed. \n",
      "The hash is stored within the crate. \n",

The worst part is his fire breath which can hit 3 times and two shot you with low fire defense.  If you have the hexer or chaos set, use flash sweat, the dispelling ring, and the red flame defense ring +2 you can cut the damage by about 70~80% depending on your int/faith (which boost fire defense when levelled).  If all else fails you can do this and summon help, just not any NPC since they suck for this fight.  Once you can tank his fire attacks he becomes much less of a threat.

I thought about the less copy+paste too, also a good thing, but also would there be less? If someone has a great design that's been able to hold up against several real attacks continuously, why not just all switch to that base because clearly even with practice and repetitive tries it's still held strong. Obviously it's a bad idea to have the same base repeating itself in your clan for the reason that it just takes one person to find the strategy, but with sandboxing, if people still haven't figured out how to beat it, it's a pretty safe bet to just copy it. I didn't think positively of the shifting meta only because it would tend to shift towards cookie cutter builds that have held up against countless pratice attacks which leads up to my thought process that people will just copy bases from other clanmates.\n",

      "\n",
      "&gt;FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;[0001]The present invention relates to a novel pharmaceutical formulation comprising a ratioed mix of: (i) one or more compounds that acts as an inverse agonist of the CB1 and/or CB2 receptor; and (ii) one or more compounds that acts as a neutral antagonist of the CB1 and/or CB2 receptor. Preferably both the inverse agonist of the CB1 and/or CB2 receptor and the neutral antagonist of the CB1 and/or CB2 receptor are cannabinoids. Preferably the cannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabidivarin (THCV) and cannabidiol (CBD).\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;BACKGROUND DESCRIPTION\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;[0002]Cannabinoids are a group of chemicals known to activate cannabinoid receptors in cells. These chemicals, which are found in cannabis plants, are also produced endogenously in humans and other animals, and are termed endocannabinoids. Synthetic cannabinoids are manmade chemicals with the same structure as plant cannabinoids or endocannabinoids.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;[0003]Cannabinoids are generally known to be cannabinoid receptor agonists. When a cannabinoid receptor agonist binds to a cannabinoid receptor a response is triggered. This response is known as a signalling pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;[0004]Compounds which are known to bind to the CB1 cannabinoid receptor include delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), R-(+)-WIN55212 and anandamide. These compounds are as such described as CB1 agonists as when they bind to the CB1 receptor a specific response is produced.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;[0005]Agonism at a receptor will often lead to an active response by the cell. **Many disease states result from the overactive or overabundant effects of agonists at their receptors.**\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;[0006]Cannabinoid receptors are known to be constitutively active. This means that the receptors undergo some degree of coupling to their signalling pathways even in the absence of an agonist. As such they exhibit a background tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;[0007]In the presence of an agonist this background tone is increased. This can cause an intensification of a disease state that has resulted from the active response of the cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;[0008]Research into compounds that are able to oppose the ability of such agonists has led to the discovery of compounds that act as cannabinoid receptor antagonists.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;[0009]A neutral antagonist is a compound that will bind to the receptor but will lack any efficacy as a receptor agonist. Such a neutral antagonist will compete with agonists for its receptor and once bound will not result in any active response. In constitutively active receptors the background tone remains unaffected.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;[0010]An inverse agonist will also bind to its receptor and will lack any efficacy as a receptor agonist. Once an inverse agonist is bound to a receptor it is able to produce an opposite effect of the active response.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;[0011]Therefore in constitutively active receptors an inverse agonist is able to either partially or completely switch off the background tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;[0012]The way in which constitutively active receptors work in the presence of agonists and different types of receptor antagonists is shown in FIG. 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;[0013]The ability of a compound to have antagonistic properties at a constitutively active receptor may be extremely beneficial in the treatment of diseases where **a change in the background tone of a cell is the cause of the disease state**.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;[0014]**Examples of diseases and conditions that are the result of the background tone of constitutively active cannabinoid receptors** include but are not limited to obesity, schizophrenia, epilepsy, cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, bone disorders such as osteoporosis, bulimia, obesity associated with type II diabetes (non-insulin dependant diabetes), the treatment of drug, alcohol and nicotine abuse or dependency and inflammatory disorders (Pertwee, R. G., 2000).\n",

Now, there is a hack that people talk about called “wire-heading” where you could actually go into the console of the Atari game and physically change the thing that produces the score on the screen. At the moment that’s not feasible for DQN, because its scope of action is entirely within the game itself; it doesn’t have a robot arm. But that’s a serious problem if the machine has a scope of action in the real world. So, could you prove that your system is designed in such a way that it could never change the mechanism by which the score is presented to it, even though it’s within its scope of action? That’s a more difficult proof.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm not saying the system will reject the idea of objective reality. Objective reality may exist, but if it does it doesn't contain paperclips. If objective reality exists, then paperclips are a mental abstraction created when a mind overlays purpose and category over a pattern in energy and matter.

      "Rosenblatt, when he was first formalizing neural nets drew a diagram of a system that's pretty universal. The AI includes effectors + sensors + internal processing units embedded in the environment. There is nothing sacred about this division. I can take the effectors and sensors and consider *them* as part of the environment. The subset of the internal processing units that interface with the old sensors and effectors become the new effectors and sensors. This redeliniation can be carried out in the opposite manner, part of what we chose to label the environment can be subsumed as part of the AI system. There is no real point were its mind ends and the world begins. As such, modifying anything in the causal chain involved in its computation of its utility is fair game.\n",

      "If you'd like to invest in a great drawing book, I really recommend this one. I love art instruction that is systematic, and breaks things down in logical ways (great for those coming from a coding perspective), and I feel this book does that. http://www.amazon.com/How-Draw-sketching-environments-imagination/dp/1933492732/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430439744&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=how+to+draw\n",

      "My main advice to learn how to draw is basically:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Practice drawing the primitive shapes everything on earth is made up of. Mainly: Spheres, Cubes, Cylinders.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Start looking for those basic shapes in everything you see.\n",
      "\n",
      "* When drawing something from your imagination, draw it absolutely as basic as you can, with those main shapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Add details with those same 3 steps of identifying shapes and relationships. DONE\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawing isn't a mystery, you can approach it like code. Everything is logical and can be measured and simplified and then applied on paper in logical steps :)\n",
      "\n",
      "Another piece of advice that I don't think is very popular: Practice by copying. For people who have always been an 'artist' since childhood, guess how they started out? Copying and tracing from stuff. It's a great way to get your hands trained and muscle memory going. If you're apprehensive about drawing because you never have, tracing and copying works really well as training wheels. OK IM DONE haha, sorry for a million edits.\n",

      "2. You need to have good boarders to help maintain a barrier between the grass and flower bed. Rocks do not make good boarders because they do not prevent grass from creeping under them. Check out the double brick boarder that I linked below. If you dig down a bit and have sand under this boarder the grass will never get into your landscape. It also prevents the mulch from getting into your lawn. This boarder is also nice because your flowers can hang over without getting in the way of the mower. There are other boarders like this but the idea is to have it deep enough to prevent grass from being able to run under.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. Get a good 3\" of mulch in there and you will find that you have much less of an issue with weeds. You probably never mulched heavily before because it would fall out because of your boarder problem. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Always use a pre-emergent weed preventer like Preen early in the Spring to prevent weeds. Combine this with the mulch and your weeding time will be less than mowing the area by far.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Plant native perennial plants in your bed.These will generally require less maintenance and watering. If you get 4-6 hours of direct sunlight then plant shaded plants. 6+ hours will work for full sunlight plants. The sun is not strong in the morning so sunlight time before 9:00 AM is negligible. \n",

      "i was just addressing the 3MB/EX pulls question as noone else had, although it is a very unbalanced deck, over a 3 match game with card control and having more higher cards than lower its a necessary tactic that works well. A lot of people use the word unbalanced here when talking about RTG decks when what they really mean is too many weak cards, having 14 great cards and 6 weak ones is unbalanced but shouldnt slow you down too much, whereas vice versa it will make a big difference as the few great ones drag the others into a higher level than they can beat far sooner, meaning far longer grinding +1s for lower cards (switching to uncommon method is usually better here with this kind of deck) so going back to my first reply, its better to do that to balance out the middle of the team without moving up as quick for balance as opposed to stretching your deck with 1 higher level card that wont help in EX/KOTR and makes it harder for the back end of your RTG deck\n",

Once that was dry, I started beating up the paint with a cotton swab that was slightly dampened with an appropriate thinner, so rubbing alcohol or Tamiya X-20A thinner. The white wash first comes off of raised edges and any high spots, and then as you keep abusing the more \"open\" painted areas, you'll start pulling paint off in larger \"sheets.\" \n",

Just make sure you don't use too much thinner in the cotton swab because you don't want pools of thinner forming on your model and you don't want thinned paint running everywhere.

I don't think I protected my paint work and I had a little bit of the base color start bleeding into the white wash but overall I thought it looked alright.\n",

I used S1000RR weight/geometry for reference.  \n",

      "For extreme throttle openings or extreme braking, the dynamics of the suspension do play an effect in the weight transfer. But again, he is not doing any of that. He is barely decelerating. The suspension doesn't move much, the chain doesn't move much, so you can treat the bike as a rigid system, where the weight transfer is directly proportional to acceleration. The effects of the chain and suspension are so minute that the irregularities in the road have a greater effect on traction than supension/chain ever will. \n",

      "The issue is that when you are applying a lateral force to the tire, it needs to grip. Sure, rolling on throttle gives the rear more weight, but you also increase speed and thus ask it to provide more grip. And if it can't grip because of cold rubber of running over some standing water, you will still go down. \n",

      "\n",
      "1. A person has some content they wish to share.\n",
      "2. They use their torrent client to create a .torrent file from the content and add the URL of private/public trackers (if desired) to facilitate initial communication between seeders and downloaders. \n",
      "3. They add the torrent in their own client and start seeding.\n",
      "4. The torrent client sends a message to the trackers and provides the IP address of the seeder. \n",
      "5. They upload the .torrent file to 1 or more websites so that other people can access it. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Downloading:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. They find the .torrent on a website, download and add it into their torrent client. \n",
      "2. The torrent client will contact the trackers listed in the .torrent file to obtain a list of IP addresses of other people who are seeding or downloading the torrent. Initially this is just the IP address of the first seeder. \n",
      "3. The downloader's client connects directly to each of the IP addresses the tracker provided and starts to download. Once a piece has been downloaded it can also be uploaded to others (you don't need to be a seeder to upload). \n",
      "4. Once finished downloading the person becomes a seeder. There isn't a lot of difference between seeder and a leecher/downloader other than the fact that seeders are known to have 100% of the content. \n",
      "\n",
      "**DHT and Peer Exchange:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This allows peers (seeders or downloaders) to find other peers without the help of a tracker. Peers will exchange information about other peers they know are seeding/downloading. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Pieces:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The torrent is split into pieces so that you can verify each piece individually to make sure that it's correct. You can also download the pieces in any order and they will be combined to form a complete file. This is extremely helpful when initially seeding a torrent as shown with example: Imagine a torrent with 2 pieces and 2 people downloading from 1 initial seeder; the initial seeder would send a different piece to each downloader such that the 2 downloaders can help each other by sending the opposite part. \n",

      "&gt;The term \"__bamboo ceiling__\" was coined by Jane Hyun in her book focusing on Asians in the workplace, *Breaking the Bamboo Ceiling: Career Strategies for Asians*.  It is defined as a combination of individual, cultural, and organisational factors that impede Asian Americans’ career progress inside organizations. Since then, a variety of sectors (including nonprofits, universities, the government) have discussed the impact of the ceiling as it relates to Asians and the challenges they face. As described by Anne Fisher, \"bamboo ceiling\" refers to the processes and barriers that serve to exclude [Asians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asians) and American people of Asian descent from executive positions on the basis of subjective factors such as \"lack of leadership potential\" and \"lack of communication skills\" that cannot actually be explained by job performance or qualifications.

At first glance X-Plane looks stripped down and not nearly as polished as FSX but thats not exactly the case.

Most people don't understand just how problematic synthetic pesticides are not just for the environment and farm workers, but our entire society.  Did you know that one of the most popular families of pesticides used in conventional agriculture, organophosphates, has been widely implicated in severe developmental neurotoxicity issues in children?

Continuing on, the most important enzyme responsible for breaking down these pesticides in the human body is called serum paraoxanase.  Some people have a lot of paraoxanase activity and are able to break down the pesticides really fast.  Guess which subpopulation scientists are beginning to find has significantly reduced paraoxanase activity?

I haven't heard from anyone who claims that they're a farmer and who wants to discuss their personal experience in this entire 2000+ comment conversation.

      "There are a lot of ways to address this, and chances are you'll need to take a multi faceted approach to repair this. Your conversation troubles are probably a symptom of something deeper. There are things like meditation, nofap, exercise, diet, learning to love and accept yourself which will all help out heaps. Then there are also more practical things such as actually trying to talk to people regularly, to become comfortable with it. But you'll never get comfortable if you set your expectations too high. Be reasonable with yourself, instead of making your goal \"I want to have a lot of things to say\", make it \"I want to try to feel comfortable\", or even better \"I want to make the other person comfortable around me, by asking them questions and learning more about them.\" (People love talking about themselves.) There's a lot to this, but basically, you have to figure out what is causing your symptoms. For me, it was things I didn't even think were issues - porn, masturbation, weed, internet + video games addiction, bad diet, no exercise. All these common things, once I started getting on top of it, I started improving everything in my life.\n",

This is ironically close to less moderate conservative justifications for limiting the liberty of others, but it's just on the left instead of the right. The difference here is between those thinking freedom of speech should be limited at offense [radical, in conflict with core liberalism] and those that think it should only be limited at harm [non-radical, inline with core liberalism.]\n",

This is the moderate view here, as it is in line with liberal theory of keeping government intervention to a minimum yet maximizing liberty. Those on the other side reject this, and focus on ambiguous social inequalities and call for government intervention. This side is radical, as they wish for the government to intervene not just in other-regarding actions in the public sphere, putting them in conflict with moderate liberalism. This side tends to advocate for parity rather than equity, hence the social focus.\n",

My mom gets shitty parents coming in all the fucking time bitching about why their childs grade isn't good enough. She always asks a simple question \"Well do you ever review the material and homework with your child after school?\", and the answer 9/10 times is \"No thats why you're here to teach them\" or \"No I don't have the time to do that, you're supposed to review the material and homework with them.\" These kids go home and don't have a single parent that will even take a half hour out of their day to sit down with their kid and make sure they're grasping the material. Then my mom gets bitched at because their child isn't doing well. Too many parents fail to grasp the simple fact that their kid isn't doing as well as they could because they don't help them outside the classroom. My mom only teaches 2nd grade, and each year the assignments / learning material gets more difficult. If these parents can't or won't help their children out with simple arithmetic or reading, then they sure as hell aren't going to help them out when they're learning algebra or writing essays a few grades later. It's really sad because they just fall further and further behind until they have to repeat a grade or they just flat out loose interest and don't graduate at all. If parents were more active in their child's education and didn't put everything off on the teacher, everything would be a lot better off.\n",

That doesn't make a bell (it's more of a low flat-top pyramid) but at least it mollifies extremely low or high results. Auto fail would have to be on a 2.

      "No we actually had the opposite problem - pretty severely.  If you look in the photos you'll see one of my bridesmaids in the turquoise dress is showing quite a bit of ankle - the Sugar Bits dresses are really made for shorter girls and she's 5'8\".  With the Sugar Bits you don't have the option of getting \"extra length\".  Most of my bridesmaids were tall (5'7\"+, and were wearing heels), so for the Two Birds dresses 3 girls actually got extra length (they add a full 4 inches).  It was key to making sure we didn't have awkward ankle showing.  My shortest Bridesmaid was 4'11\", wearing only 1.5 inch heels in the Sugar bits, and she didn't have to hem at al (in fact none of my girls hemmed their dresses)l.  The big thing with the convertible wrap dresses is that every time you tie them it will be slightly different so the dress will change lengths - you can adjust the length a ton to shorten it (or lengthen it) by changing the tie slightly. However, if you do need to hem its a no-rip no-fray fabric, so a tailor or dry cleaner can cut it with standard scissors.\n",

      "PoR is kind of a funny one, because with BEXP anything is possible. Units like Marcia and Jill join with shakey base stats, but you can just pump them full of BEXP and their good growths and flying ability will take care of the rest. Here's my list of who to use:\n",
      "\n",
      "Top growth units:\n",
      "Boyd, Oscar, Kieran, Jill, Marcia, Astrid. All of these units have really high movement (except Boyd) that compliments great stats. They all come in the first half of the game too. The latter three start off with mediocre bases, but are extremely easy to train with BEXP and will pay huge dividends. When the cavaliers promote, I recommend picking axes for Oscar and Astrid, and lances for Kieran. Axes are just really good in this game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure things: Titania, Tanith, Stefen, Muarim, Janaff, Ulki, Calill. These guys have really good base stats as well as good growths. As such, you really can't go wrong with them. Tanith in particular is pretty ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just trust me\": Mist. Without spoiling anything, there is a certain part of the game that will be made a lot easier by having a decently powered Mist. Basically it just removes some (but not all) of the RNG from a certain fight (which you can just skip if you want to).\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't be afraid to drop: Nephenee, Soren. Both of these units are much beloved for being cool characters with high potential. However, both of them require a lot of babying to be effective. If they're not turning out good or you're not enjoying training them I would recommend dropping them.\n",
      "\n",
      "BONUS GUY: Mordecai. Mordecai may or may not remain a useful combat unit to you, but he will always be useful for one reason: smite! When transformed, Mordecai can push ANY unit two spaces, even mounted units. This is extremely useful, and will often make him a great filler pick even lategame.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for stat boosters, use them as soon as you get them. +2 defense matters a lot more early than it does late! I would recommend using your stat boosters to hit important thresholds early. If somebody is having a hard time doubling, throw them a speedwings. If you want to be more reckless with a more fragile unit give them the dracoshields and angelic robes.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for supports, in FE9 characters get support points just from being deployed together! The only thing that effects supports is how many maps units are deployed on together, so as long as you consistently use both getting an A and a B support will be a snap.\n",
      "\n",
      "FE9 barely has any promotion items. Most units will promote by hitting level 20 and then leveling up one more time. There are a small number of master seals, and using one to give a unit like Oscar a quick shot of strength when he hits level 15 or so might be a good idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "BONUS FACT: [The knight ward!](http://fireemblem.wikia.com/wiki/Knight_Ward) The knight ward is a piece of equipment that comes with Astrid. Knights, soldiers, and cavaliers can equip it. It gives a bonus to def and res, which is nice, but even better it gives an extra 30% to the units speed growth! When leveling up units with BEXP, make sure that if they can equip the knight ward they have it equipped before leveling up.\n",
      "\n",
      "ONE MORE TIP!: You get a LOT of money in this game. Like, a ridiculous amount. Don't be afraid to blow a lot on weapons, particularly making really strong forged weapons. You can and probably should make one shiny new OP weapon per chapter.\n",
      "The worst I had was explaining a problem to a student. I started with a generic explanation, hoping he'd catch on to some concepts.

So what's 0 + 500\" and says \"500\" and then I say \"ok so what's the answer\" and he says \"0\".\n",

      "One thing I plan to do to test my Stewart Platform when it's built is a similar technique we used in a precision machine design class I took at MIT (Class number 2.75). This paper from a previous year project of the class ( http://web.mit.edu/2.75/lab/KC%20Report%20-%20Matt%20Rosario.pdf ) describes the technique. Put your machine somewhere a fixed, known distance away from a wall and shine a laser that is stiffly mounted to the top platform at that wall. Put a piece of printed graph paper on the wall, with that laser point at the origin. Then have your platform move around in some slow, conservative fashion then go back home. mark that new laser point. Repeat at the same speed a few times. These new points should hopefully be close to where the previous one was. If it is right on that previous point for many data points, then you know the repeatability of that point is at least +- the radius of the laser dot at that distance, which is a good thing! If you need to check it for deeper repeatability find a longer hallway and try the experiment again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then I would repeat the same experiment a bunch of times at a faster speed to see how that may affect your repeatability. Kind of like generating a bode plot, your accuracy and repeatability will go down as you push the robot harder, but then you will know how far you can push it and let the end user decide where their speed/accuracy tradeoff lies. \n",

      "Of those skills, I'd say the HG Earplugs, Status Atk +2, and Mind's Eye are necessary, the Evasion +1 is really handy, but the set is about making the monster fall asleep as much as possible, and those roars are perfect opportunities to stack a lot of sleep on a monster. Mind's Eye is there because the Plesiperse Spike+ does not have amazing sharpness on it base, and Sharpness +1 does help a lot but overall I decided to take Mind's Eye instead, since sharpening really isn't my thing.\n",

      "Mortal's Ardor is such a better sideboard card than Ordeal of Heliod for its job. It has so much versatility. Against fast red decks, what do you fear? You fear A) Getting life to zero and B) Getting your creature burnt before it grows. Against Red Decks burning a creature, Mortal's Ardor might as well be God's Willing, because it buffs +1/+1 and trigger's heroic to push things out of burn range, at instant speed. And its gives that now bigger creature lifelink, which is highly relevant to the combat of the turn that burn was made. And for its pure lifegain, maybe its not 10 full life, but pushed after a Defiant Strike on a fresh 2/2 heroic its 6 life, and if you already have a souped up creature, you're gonna win every race the same as an Ordeal would. Another thing about its instant speed is not allowing Atarka Red players to just leave up Command mana, knowing when that lifegain is gonna come, like on an Ordeal pop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having played it with a smile every single time, I firmly stand by this trick against red decks. I believe in 2 main Ordeal of Heliods (Ordeals being better against midranges and controls due to getting the creatures bigger on average) with the full 4 Ardor's in the side, given it can be brought in against any deck where Life, Toughness, and Combat Tricks matter.\n",

      "Ammy basics come down to knowing how her stances work and how to use paper. Here's a kinda shoddy guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflector is great up close as her jump and stand H are great throw OS buttons. If you do an air dash down forward H overhead, it will also tech air throw attempts. Forward H target combo OS's throws and allows you to keep close to your opponent and fight advancing guard if they block/push block. This is greatly strengthened by smart paper usage which I'll get into later. Since it's generally used for close-quarters you can also use her parry to counter players who defend with their face: if the player likes to Foot Dive or Helm Breaker a lot, the parry should keep them in check. Projectile reflector allows you to close the gap midscreen against some characters, but you have to know what you can reflect and what you can only nullify. Also keep an eye on their meter so you don't do something like reflect a Hawkeye arrow only to get hit with Gimlet. There are situations where your opponent has no meter and you can force them into a stalemate. To use Hawkeye again as an example, if he has no bar you can reflect or nullify everything he has, which will make most Hawkeyes come towards you. Likely they will slide at you which you can M parry, and if they do jump H you likely won't get hit cause Ammy is so short. Just one example!\n",
      "\n",
      "Glaive is great for closing the gap and also for up close offense. Super jump air dash j.H sometimes crosses up, has a huge hitbox, and leads to her best damage solo combos. Just be careful not to get thrown. If you have assists available you can do 236M or H to take to the sky, then call assists from super jump height to cover your approach. c.H is a super long range low that you can confirm off of with 236L. Using both j.H and 2H from midrange can really abuse characters who can't swing at her from that range, such as Dorm and Nova. Glaive Dive (j.3H) has a great hitbox and beats stuff like forward Foot Dive and even Wolvie's dive kick in many situations, and is hard for people to anti-air as well. Also crosses up a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beads are mostly used for j.H; it has a great hitbox and unlike Glaive j.H can be canceled which means she gets super jump confirms and can keep up pressure from the air. Cold Star is great for chipping people out and keeping them in check from afar. After full-screen Shuffle or level 3, L Cold Star is guaranteed chip. M version catches people jumping a lot and can be canceled into Shuffle for good stray damage. Other than that the ground Bead normals are situational and/or matchup specific. They are excellent vs armor characters and big guys as they are her longest range normals and always do multiple hits. For instance vs Hulk you stay at mid range putting down M paper when he jumps, then abuse him with 2H or target combo for best damage from long range. There are other specific things like vs Raccoon; if he puts down a trap you can use 2H and the target combo to keep him from moving while he tries to camp. You gotta play her matchups a lot and see what works. The obvious general problem with beads ground normals is that they don't offer super good rewards for clean hits, although you can do stuff like hail mary 2H, XFC, dash forward and combo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok so paper: this is the one special besides Head Charge that she can use in any stance, and it is SO good at controlling space that mastering it is critical. You can usually tell how good an Ammy player is by how effective their paper placement is. I recommend watching lots of MarlinPie as his paper footsies are incredible. Paper is +6 on hit and block if the guide is to be believed. Meaning if you get a hit close enough or a counter hit/trade you can confirm off it easily, and if they push block you're +30 or something, giving you time to put down more paper or stance switch. In X-factor it's very easy to confirm off a stray paper hit into death. In general you want to use L paper after a push block, M if you're not getting push blocked, and H as an anti-air or for space control and also great incoming setups. Glaive 5/2H can both be canceled into paper which leads to amazing space control. 5Hxx M or H paper is so stupid strong vs characters like Haggar who can't really get in vs it.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all the tips I've given you so far, Ammy probably sounds like a footsies character who can do a bit of everything on offense and defense. This applies mostly to solo, non-XF Ammy. With her best assists like Bolts or Jam she's a dominant point character. With x-factor 3 your goal is to go somewhat ham and kill two characters. If you're left with 1v1, you can't be obsessed with trying to get the hit. Play safe. Use slow a lot. Don't be afraid to reset if you have to. Hit and run when you have the lead. Get good reads on your opponents habits and offensive tendencies. You don't have Spiral Swords or Ouroboros so nothing is really gonna bail you out with one input.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some other random info:\n",

Your wrong.\" Now person B is objectively and factually correct in his conclusion. His argument was the only thing flawed. The purpose of fallacies is to weed out shit arguments, however a shitty argument doesn't make one wrong. It just means you need to explain your side differently.

You could either go for straight design, you could be more conceptual and learn to be an art director (not in terms of being someone's boss, more like how in ad agencies they have teams where a Copywriter and Art Director work together) or you could do Service Design, which is what a lot of people now called UX. \n",

      "Personally, I chose initially to go the agency route and with my Advertising degree focus they helped me out a lot in terms of knowing the structure of how work was done and they shaped our curriculum around the reviews.

She's like you guys, second guessing the fact that she paid so much for her education, trying to figure out if it was all worth it or not. I've talked to her fellow classmates and they are all in the same boat. Their school has made them bitter towards our field, and they are the type of people who constantly champion the fact that you don't need to go to school to be a designer and that if you just spend your time teaching yourself and Lynda you'll do fine.\n",

It is an [electrically insulating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_insulation), stable [fluorocarbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorocarbon)-based fluid which is used in various cooling applications. It is mainly used for cooling electronics. Different molecular formulations are available with a variety of [boiling points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_point), allowing it to be used in \"single phase\" applications where it remains a liquid, or for \"two-phase\" applications where the liquid boils to remove additional heat via [evaporative cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporative_cooling). An example of one of the compounds 3M uses is [FC-72](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorohexane) (perfluorohexane, C6F14). Perfluorohexane is used for low temperature [heat transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer) applications due to its 56 °C (133 °F) boiling point. Another example is [FC-75](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC-75), perfluoro(2-butyl-tetrahydrofurane).

I suspect you're using Python 3 (*) in which case `dict.values()` returns a view, and my crystal ball says you were trying to call a `.sort()` method on this object, which failed because a dict view has no such method since a dict view cant' be sorted because it's just a view to the values in a dict, and dicts are unordered.  `sorted(dict.values())` works because that creates a new list, rather than trying to sort a list in-place.

Under these circumstance any sort of marital abuse is going to be heavily under-reported and have abysmal conviction rates.

Honestly, if you trust her, she trusts you, and you guys are in love you have nothing to worry about. One year is a good amount of time to know who someone really is. Most of the time these parties only last a few hours and then everyone goes to the bars. Why don't you just pregame with your friends and then meet her out? That's what I used to do. Besides, she can and probably does have a lot of guy friends that are in said frats. You cannot tell her you do not want her to go to these parties, that is controlling. She IS in a sorority. She IS greek life. That's just the way it is. Frats and sororities meet up and drink together. Again, it all boils down to trust and whether or not you are comfortable with her getting hit on. Have you never seen your girlfriend get hit on? It's almost like a compliment to you. Because these dudes can try and try and try but in the end, she is coming home to you. You can't control other people and trying to is futile. Let her go, let her have fun, and you go have fun with your friends. It will be okay, I promise.\n",

All of those can be used for animations. Most should be able to export animated GIFs and movies directly; if not, you can just output a series of static pictures and join them together to an animated GIF using the free and open source [Imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) or [Graphicsmagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/).

Octave has the advantage of being mostly compatible with MATLAB, but it is generally slow (though fast at linear algebra) and somewhat frustrating to set up certain packages in my experience. Sage is mostly compatible with mathematica and is quite well-perceived.

After you reach the halfway point of the stage, start spamming Macho/Wall cats. Also, produce your first True Valkyrie once you reach this halfway point. This stage requires you to push slowly while stacking your Dragon Cats. Produce occasional Sexy Legs cat too. You'll likely have 2-3 Valkyries and a bunch of Dragon Cats by the time that Bun Bun appears. You can also produce Baby Cats cause they have 30% knockback against floating and a bit tanky. Bun Bun outranges them though, so I'm not exactly sure if he'll help (Probably with a lot of meatshields, take it with a grain of salt.)

Produce Dragon and Valkyries when they are available. Sexy Legs will help push too (Dragon cat's cd is longer than this one, but prioritize Dragon cats). Even if your first sizeable Dragon army died, don't panic too much because they have already done significant damage to Bun Bun. Another wave of those Dragons/Sexy Legs + 2 Meatshield spam + occasional Valkyries will grant you victory over Bun Bun. Just spam the rest of the damage cats after defeating Bun Bun and Victory!\n",

      "Newer players wouldn't care that they can start the next stage with the boss since most of the time they would just end up hitting the leave battle button and grinding for a while. The cutting to boss aspect is of lesser importance to them compared to the +100% damage each level. Any player who WOULD be concerned about cutting to a boss each level already has plenty of %AD, and would just love to reduce the time it takes to get to the stages where they have to work. A lot of people seem to be against you, it seems, since many approved of the battle I idea which you could use twice a day to skip way up to your grinding levels.

The NDP have done very good in terms of [balancing budgets and minimizing deficits](http://www.progressive-economics.ca/2011/04/29/fiscal-record-of-canadian-political-parties/). Sometimes, as in Saskatchewan under Romanov, they start out with really crappy **inherited problems** from previous governments. [Even Bob Rae's NDP government in Ontario had a massive up-hill battle, thanks to an adversarial business community](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/second-reading/the-hidden-history-of-bob-raes-government-in-ontario/article1314254/?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=Referrer%3A+Social+Network+%2F+Media&amp;utm_campaign=Shared+Web+Article+Links). So don't be too quick to blame the NDP... I've started to discover that's largely a trope that gets thrown out by other political parties in an attempt to discredit them, while hoping that you, the voter, never look deeper than their shallow comments. While no government nor party is perfect, including the NDP, I think that we need to move past the tropes and innuendo to look at the real numbers, to see their real successes and failures. \n",

You're at 680s which means you probably never done a 140 with that set (unless you're wearing a gunner cap).  I rather kick you so you can help other people lvling their gq's that's not at 140 and get your divine spheres at the same time.  If a person is at 750s + it means they've at least done some 120s+.  It's more about coming prepared than the def numbers.  If there are two others with 750s+ it shows me that they've at least prepared beforehand rather than just going from g3 to 140.  It's unfair for the other two and im not going to risk it just so you can 'try' it.  Even if we fail at least everyone came prepared.  I've leveled too many gq where 680s came in and just leave cause it's not 140.  Sure it might not be their weapon bias, but clearly they havent upgrade their def with divine spheres.

      "\n",
      "But there are degrees that other items that serve different purposes increase your farm and situations for each of them. For example, survivability items like a bracer can save your life from a gank, that's 200 gold and 30 seconds of downtime. A heart or a bloodstone can make you ungankable, which let's you farm in crazier places. Same thing with a blink or shadowblade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now for wraith specific stuff. A midas gets you level 16 fastest of course. But it only helps you. A blink or shadowblade means you can farm lanes and bait people. Versus most heroes without AOE DOT (area damage over time like timber or radiance) wraith can blink away and TP. This alone probably increases your farm and gives you away to initiate for you team as well as chase. Naked brown/any boots+blink+quell is a decent thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treads+Blademail+Radiance would be a good build to decide on going before a match starts. If radiance seems out of the question, like 30 minutes or more, you might start going a situational item. Pick a hero on their team and build an item that prevents them from being useful. Auras like vlads and now pipe are great, wraith doesn't like BKB every game since he lives longer than a BKB duration usually. and single target stuff like force, halberd, or orchid all can work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Midas is fine, wraith can't jungle for his life though. The way I usually support is this if I'm not on tilt (from other players or previous games). I usually see if a stun can kill the enemies farming against our safe lane. If so? Try, check if they have regen and just trade with them. This will help your game the most, as long as your carry feels safer. Even if they can't cs well, they will cs better. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you're radiant safelane, usually you can secure the rune for yourself at 2 minutes. A smoke or boots first means you can usually get behind the enemy mid. If you see them get below their hill, it means you should go for it. Go into a replay of a match, look at the enemy mid's perspective. Many times they go down the hill to last hit and can't see a path of darkness you can walk through. I wish I had a video I could reference, but I don't. I'm sure ganking mid videos in general will come up if you google them.\n",

      "\n",
      "From there, don't get a stout unless you really feel the enemy won't come gank you. Choke point jungle wraith and get a TP and a quelling blade ASAP. With the changes to wards, now wraith has the item slots to carry stout+quelling+sentries and observers. But I still feel on many supports, regen is better than damage block. Like don't get a stout on a support that needs to carry consumables. Smokes and observers don't share slots still for example.\n",

      "Armlet is fine. I don't want to dismiss completely, but it's just sort of habit that players have after all these years of Dota. Like Kunkka Shadowblade. Things change. Doens't mean they negatively affect the hero.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want armor, blademail I feel is better on wraith. If you need regen, wraith doesn't need much. He has decent lifesteal with on point of vamp aura. Madness is another option and will sustain you in the jungle better than armlet. If you need both, armlet might be your thing. Caution though, armlet toggling is really weak right now. Urns are everywhere. Battlefury+armlet give a ton of regen, but wraith doesn't need that much. I would skip armlet if you're going battlefury. \n",
      "\n",
      "Get yelled at all you want for suggesting phase boots. Doesn't mean he's right. Phase boots help you stun and kite better. They're for running at people. Treads are for when you are getting run AT more. And treads do scale into late game better, but by a small amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you go BKB armlet first, I wouldn't be scared of that wraith king. That's honestly all of the game you should think about. The first 2k+ gold item. And your first 4k+ gold item. Many games it's unfortunately a BKB. \n",
      "\n",
      "Going late game though? That's easy to imagine. For example, many games, you don't want desolator in your late game build, but many games, it's necessary because you bought it. If so, you go for tower pushing and get assault and mjollnir. That'd be my guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that the strongest item build is something like (travels) (Silver's edge/Blink)(Abyssal)(BKB)(Refresher)(Rapier). The reason why I always look for the refresher,bkb, lockdown item build is because the problem that many carries get into lategame is they don't have an aegis slot. You want to get a strong 6 slot as soon as possibl,e and many games, this means having two 5 seconds BKBs and lockdown and a rapier. Now there are a lot of exceptions, mostly evasion heroes and BKB piercing heroes and other abyssal carriers. From there you have to decide what you want to give up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assault and Heart are good, but far from core. A heart versus a percentage based hero like AA, Zeus, or Necrolyte has it's drawbacks, and that's where you want the refresher+BKB instead. Most games you won't even get here though. And assault could be a lotus orb or a moon shard, depending on whether you need more or one aspect of AC or another, Attack speed or armor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radiance is rarely in a 6 slot build. Now that it has the miss chance, it's a lot better, but people will eventually get MKBs on heroes that want to kill you. If you're selling 5k gold items, the game has hit a point you shouldn't theory craft about too hard. Think more 30 minutes if you can find like 6k gold worth of items, which isn't absurd.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, don't take my word for it. Try things out yourself. Look at what the item helped you versus. A lot of the items I'm suggesting enough probably don't have enough AOE or single target damage, which you specifically need in some games.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TL:DR** Think about when you want to get your levels and farm. For supports, do what you can in the first 5 minutes. Then focus on if you need to continue doing that or start getting your own farm and XP. Armlet and battlefury aren't a good standard build, they are really hard to fight with, especially without shadowblade or blink. Just try more items. You'll see what heroes they're good against, and which ones aren't. Wraith is one of those heroes that can use way too many items and generally that's half the fun. Sure you'll get flamed for building vlads on wraith, but many players can't even fathom how a vlads for the team can be more useful than an armlet for wraith himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "P.S. No one wants to watch a wraith king with no boots farm the jungle. get boots before midas unless you have free farm in a lane. Just get a later midas at that point.\n",

      "&gt;The __QWERTZ__ or __QWERTZU__ [keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphanumeric_keyboard) is a widely used [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) and [typewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter) keyboard layout that is mostly used in [Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe) [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe). The name comes from the first six letters at the top left of the keyboard: *Q*, *W*, *E*, *R*, *T*, and *Z*.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;The main difference between QWERTZ and [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY) is that the positions of the \"Z\" and \"Y\" keys are switched, this change being made for two major reasons:\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;* \"Z\" is a much more common letter than \"Y\" in German; the latter rarely appears outside words whose spellings reflect either their [importation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan_word) from a foreign language or the [Hellenization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenization) of an older German form under the [influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_I_of_Bavaria#Cultural_legacy) of [Ludwig I of Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_I_of_Bavaria).\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;* \"T\" and \"Z\" often appear next to each other in the [German orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_orthography), and placing the two keys next to each other minimizes the effort needed for typing the two characters in sequence (*cf.* the use of a single-block *tz* [ligature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature) in many early mechanical [printing presses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) using *[fraktur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur_(script\\))* typefaces).\n",

      "\n",
      "&gt;* QWERTZ keyboards usually change the right [Alt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_key) key into an [Alt Gr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_Gr) key to access a third level of key assignments. This is necessary because the language-specific characters leave no room to have all the special symbols of [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), needed by programmers among others, available on the first or second (shifted) levels without unduly increasing the size of the keyboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;* The placements of some special symbols are changed when compared to the English (UK and US) versions of QWERTY.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Some of special key inscriptions are often changed from an abbreviation to a graphical symbol (for example \"Caps Lock\" becomes a hollow arrow pointing down, \"Backspace\" becomes a left-pointing arrow). In German and Austrian keyboards, most of the other abbreviations are replaced by German abbreviations (thus e.g. \"Ctrl\" for \"control\" is [translated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calque) to its German equivalent \"Strg\" for \"Steuerung\"). \"Esc\" for \"escape\" is not translated however.\n",

The other day though, he did give me a hug when I left. The one thing that really stood out was how anxious he looked going in for the hug. He was biting his lip and everything.

      "First, if anyone is being harsh don't sweat it... you shouldn't feel ashamed of where you're at. The fact that you're here and asking for help means that you want to better your life and that's a positive thing, not something someone should be tearing you down for. We are all in whatever place we're in for lots of reasons, many of which weren't our choosing - how we're raised, etc. Habits are really hard to change, especially around eating in my experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "People have given a lot of good advice but here's my take. Here's what you can do:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Decrease your spending. People have noted that you should focus on decreasing your food expenses. This isn't easy in my experience, so be realistic that it may take time for you to adjust. Junk food has an addictive quality and it will take time to get used to eating healthier and differently. If you commit to it and accept that you'll likely 'relapse' then you can get far. Don't get discouraged and keep trying and you'll get there. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Increase your income. You seem like a bright enough guy and I'm sure you are capable of earning more than $10 an hour. Consider looking for a new job or starting in a new career.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Learn about how to change your habits. I was introduced to the idea of changing habits from zenhabits.com but if it's not your cup of tea there are other resources out there. Basically, there are structured ways you can go about changing patterns of behavior that aren't helping you. Maybe that's eating better, maybe that's starting to budget, maybe that's exercising regularly. Whatever. Anyway, learning about how to change habits increases the probability that you actually will make changes, instead of writing down a new years resolution and quitting in a week, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Find a system to help with budgeting, as that may make it easier. I personally like YNAB, but there are other options, some free. Budgeting and saving for goals is easier when you have motivation. What do you want to save for? I'd start with an emergency fund. Also remember: if you can't pay for it in cash, you can't afford it (exceptions being car + student loans within reason).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. I know it's a huge challenge, but work on your anxiety if you can, as that will open up new avenues in life for you. Feel free to ignore me, but since your anxiety sounds bad enough to be affecting your quality of life I would recommend you consider therapy. There's no shame in it... in fact it's a sign of strength. If you can't afford therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy techniques can be a huge help. [This](http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-The-Mood-Therapy/dp/0380810336) book is cheap and I found it extremely beneficial in my case. \n",

I had developed a drinking problem shortly after - but countered it by switching to the allmighty-heavensent-plant.

      "Naive as I was; we spent a few days chatting and found she was actually a smart girl - spent time in the park reading books and she also worked as a nanny. As you can probably guess; we arranged to meet not far from where she worked and I knew there was a lovely park not far from there (was supposed to meet outside the underground station; park was few minutes away).\n",
      "I arrive there 15 minutes early thinking I'll have enough time to get myself a bottled drink and have time to smoke a fag. Right outside the station however; there were two benches. On one of them there was a newspaper so I sat down doing my thing and going through the paper. On the other bench however (right in my face -.-) was the hugest motherfucking beast I have ever seen. Didn't pay much attention; as I was quite select about the girls I'd meet.\n",
      "She was reading a book (which covered most of her face); and to my surprise she gets up (god knows how) and asks if I'm there to meet whatever her name was.\n",
      "I must've been stoned because I told her indeed I was. Skip the introductions; she has a blanket with her and mentions if we could head into the store that I had come out of so she can get a drink. I couldn't help my manners and I had offered to pay; a total of about £5 for what was a bottle of coke and 1241341235141 fucking SNACKS! THAT'S RIGHT! Bitch be getting fat on my dough! First date as well...\n",
      "Anyhow; we head to the park and by this time all I wanted to do was smoke a big fat one and enjoy the weather - forgetting the drama that was slowly but surely unfolding. \n",
      "So we sat ourselves down; there were tons of people around (young; slim and shit) with her being the only fucking planet about. I didn't mind; since I get along with anybody (after a few puffs who doesn't). We sit and talk; she was new to the country so I did most of the talking and I didn't mind; apart from the fact that she wouldn't had been able to talk anyhow while showing them crisps down her throat. \n",
      "Two or three spliffs later; darkness starts setting in so I do tell I have to make my way home. She asks me to give her a hand standing up (....); we make our way out of the park and she knew I had 1 more spiff rolled up in my pocket. So she asks me to light it up with her; or if I wouldn't mind giving it to her so she has something to smoke later on (AS IF; that's my bedtime spliff bitch). \n",
      "I kindly refuse; she seemed to be okay with it and everything was in order. I did text her goodnight that night (she walked home alone; and me and my manners....).\n",
      "So the following day we don't speak at all (it was OBVIOUS there was no attraction between us; or at least I didn't give her any reason to think so) and she starts calling my phone late in the evening a number of times. \n",
      "I didn't pick up; only to find my inbox full of messages 20 minutes later mentioning how I'm the most HORRIBLE person ever; that I've only ever toyed with her feelings and lead her on. She also threw in a number of other insults inbetween the lines.\n",
      "Then a few days later; like same story again. Fatty Russian chick (thought there were none of those around lol...) I end up meeting with same sort of pictures on profile. Only this one would bite her teeth without realising every now and again (which I thought was odd o.O). Only to find out 10 minutes later after we hit some of that spliff that she had tried every freaking drug out there and was 120% a heroin addict. Also; the most shallow person I think I've ever met. Pathological liar (making up stories how she's in London as a photographer for a magazine; but that her employer isn't paying her on time and she has no food to eat - which she mentioned at least 2000 times as if I would feel sorry and buy her the whole fucking Tesco's for her to munch on).

(You might even consider ±[√2005]±2, just to be even more thorough.) These should give you good candidates for the integer value [*x*]. From there, take 2005/[*x*] to see whether you can find a suitable value of *x* (whose greatest integer value should be your original [*x*], of course!) that would then satisfy *x*[*x*]=2005.\n",

      "&gt;The __spotlight effect__ is the phenomenon in which people tend to believe they are noticed more than they really are. Being that one is constantly in the center of one's own world, an *accurate* evaluation of how much one is noticed by others has shown to be uncommon. The spotlight effect was first reported in 1999, when Thomas Gilovich and Kenneth Savitsky coined the term.  The reasoning behind the spotlight effect comes from our human tendency to forget that although one is the center of one's own world, one is not the center of everyone else's. This tendency is especially prominent when one does something atypical.  Research has empirically shown that such drastic over-estimation of one's effect on others is widely common. Many professionals in social psychology encourage people to be conscious of the spotlight effect and to allow this phenomenon to moderate the extent to which one believes one is in a social spotlight. \n",

Most aspects here, besides the huge amount of grinding to level up and get skill points, are what we in the NA/EU are used to and or desire and it's simple as that. The best outcome would be for a KR CBT3 or similar version for the west, but for arguments sake, let's assume we don't get that and we have the retarded AI mobs and everything else we currently have on the KR version just brought over. There is a ton of stuff to do! Even with 90%+ of the game translated, many foreign players, and heck even loads of Koreans, don't even bother with so many features of this game. You need to come into this game thinking it's basically Archeage in my opinion. This way you will know there's so much to do and needed to do to advance. Now unfortunately, or should I say, on the other hand, this isn't exactly true because if you grind enough you can buy what you need off the AH. This method is perfectly fine for those who want to mindlessly grind. Don't get me wrong, I have done it this way in many games, opposed to earning income other ways or what have you because of my personal nature...However, there's no need for a lot of that if you play the way you are \"supposed to\"  ex: literal farming, mining, crafting, housing, taming for a profit/breeding, fishing, and much much more. \n",

      "\n",
      "He's very meticulous and efficient. He came to us as a 30yr old \"Billy the Kid\", and the guy was like a basketball savant. He took over a team the outgoing coach Lon Kruger said \"would never be able to win consistently, because kids don't want to play for Florida\", and for 20yrs he won consistently. Made us one of the best teams in the nation, before him Florida basketball was just one big pile of shit.\n",
      "\n",
      " His teams love to pass a shit ton and that usually ends up draining the shot clock until getting a great efficient look. Usually he runs with an athletic big down low (Pat Young, Joakim Noah, Al Horford) to get rebounds and surrounds him with talented shooters on the perimeter. The shooters on the outside take the majority of the shots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Donovan is a defensively minded coach, and he stresses defense play from guards more than anything. Try and disrupt the other team before they cross half court (not necessarily a full court press though). Protect the lane and post. Force them to shoot from the outside. Force a bunch of passes and capitalize on mistakes for traps, turnovers, and fastbreak points. It breaks teams with its consistency and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "I doubt he'll run the same defense in the NBA. In college he ran a lot of full court presses and that just won't work in the nba due to the talent difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were never really super super good at having the best recruits. Donovans best year ever he had a 2 star (SEC POTY), a 3 star, 2 four stars, and a 5 star as our starting 5. We were the best team in the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was voted by NBA GMs as the best coach at developing players overall and best at creating NBA players.\n",
      "\n",
      "His NBA equal would probably be greg popovich. Besides Duncan, popovich and the Spurs have built championship level teams out of non lottery draft picks. The 04s (what we call the recruiting class that won us back to back championships. Joakim Noah, Corey Brewer, Al Horford) were all either 4 stars or 3 stars. No one ranked in the top 30 coming out of highschool. It's not the most exciting basketball, but damnit it works and it's a very precise system perfected through lots of repetition. Great at identifying players and properly using them in their roles.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm interested in seeing how Donovan does with a team that's overall physically one of the best in the league like OKC is. The only time I can think he really had the most talented team overall was when he was coaching his team USA youth teams. He dominated. Never lost. Averaged 35+pts margin of victory. Won multiple world championships. They beat one team by like 85pts last year. He's the heir apparent to take over the adult team USA from Coach K once he retires.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might not like his system, but you'll like the wins he gets from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll be honest, I don't think Durant or Westbrook will ever win another scoring title under Donovan. If they fall into their roles and listen to Donovans coaching I think they will win an actual title though, and when it's all said and done that's what matters.\n",
      "\n",

It affects [spinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation) [missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile), and has some engineering uses, for instance in the design of [rotor ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_ship) and [Flettner aeroplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flettner_airplane).\n",
